# Python Websockets Example: Shared editor

This is a simple application based on https://github.com/heroku-examples/python-websockets-chat
that uses Flask, Flask-Sockets, Gevent, and Gunicorn, and Google's diff_match_patch.js to 
share a text editor among clients.

Remote code execution using docker coming soon.
